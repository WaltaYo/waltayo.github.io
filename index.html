    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Walta Yoseph. Originally from Eritrea and Kenya, 
        I have lived in Ohio for close to 2 decades and I consider it my adopted home. I am naturally curious and
        interested in solving problems, be it a personal problem, or a math problem, or any other kind of problem. 
        Goal driven and solution oriented, I also take pleasure in getting to know the people I am working with
        and fostering a collaborative atmosphere. Take it from me, I would be a great addition to any team!
