                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Walta Yoseph. Originally from Eritrea and Kenya,
                    I have lived in Ohio for close to 2 decades and I consider it my adopted home. I am naturally
                    curious and
                    interested in solving problems, be it a personal problem, or a math problem, or any other kind of
                    problem.
                    Goal driven and solution oriented, I also take pleasure in getting to know the people I am working
                    with
                    and fostering a collaborative atmosphere. I would be a great addition to any team!
                </p>
