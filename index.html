                <p>
                    Walta is a passionate Java developer with a rich professional background in the finance industry and
                    a strong educational foundation in environmental science. This diverse blend of experiences equips

                    principles
                    and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Additionally, her expertise extends to REST APIs, Web
                    Design,
                    HTML, and CSS. Walta excels not only in technical proficiency but also in fostering a collaborative
